# Roll Tracker

## Summary
In various gacha games, saving different currencies is very important. Many players often use spreadsheets to manually track the number of pulls/rolls they have, and in order to do this many conversions have to be calculated due to there being different types of currencies. However, I wanted to create a program that does this automatically.
  
### How It Works:
If a player wants to input their currencies for a game, all they would need to do is select their game and type out how much of each item they have.

Once they are done, simply press the submit button in order to update their current pulls. Every entry is also cached so a player can look back on their currency trends.
